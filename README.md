# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic - Kaggle Competition

## 📌 Overview  
**Spaceship Titanic** is a **machine learning classification competition** hosted on **Kaggle**, where the goal is to predict which passengers were **transported to an alternate dimension** after a mysterious anomaly struck the spaceship.

The challenge is based on **real-world data science techniques**, involving feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and classification model building.

## 🛠️ Task  
Using the **passenger records** recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system, predict whether a passenger was transported to another dimension.  

The dataset includes information such as:
- Passenger groupings  
- Cabin assignments  
- Spendings on amenities  
- Personal details (e.g., VIP status, home planet)  

## 📊 Evaluation  
Submissions are evaluated based on **classification accuracy**, meaning the percentage of correct predictions.  

**Submission Format:**  
A CSV file with the following structure:

```
PassengerId,Transported
0013_01,False
0018_01,False
0019_01,False
0021_01,False
...
```
